> *this is a Docker + TypeScript test*


## Introduction
This project demonstrates a basic setup which creates a dockerized RESTful NodeJS application that manages a database of users and a todo list for each user.


## Specifics
1. Use TypeScript.
2. Your application should use a RESTful API to manage CRUD.
3. Your application should be built inside a docker container.
4. Persist the data to a MySQL DB.
5. Any NodeJS framework can be used if you so wish. ie Nest.JS
6. Once completed, upload the source code in a git repo to a publicly accessible repository manager.
